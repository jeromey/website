So you've probably seen them online, dreamed about owning one and finally resolved to spend the absorbant amount of money to buy one. The Anthurium Warocqueanum takes the throne for most tricky Anthurium to keep in pristine condition. These are the things I'm trying and my results!

## Plant background
The Anthurium Warocqueanum is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it grows in the understory of humid rainforests. It prefers warm, tropical climates with temperatures ranging from 65-85°F (18-29°C). In its natural habitat, the Anthurium Warocqueanum grows as an epiphyte, meaning it grows on other plants or objects for support, but can also grow in soil.
This beautiful tropical plant is native to the rainforests of Colombia and Ecuador, and is prized for its long, pendant shaped leaves and lush velvety texture.

## Lighting requirements
The Anthurium Warocqueanum prefers bright, indirect light. Direct sunlight can scorch its leaves, so it's best to keep it out of direct sunlight. It can also do well under grow lights, provided they are the right distance from the plant and on for the right amount of time.
## Soil and fertilization requirements
Anthurium Warocqueanum likes well-draining soil that is high in organic matter. A mix of orchid bark, sphagnum moss, perlite and charcoal works well. Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer, such as 20-20-20 or 10-10-10 every 2-3 months during the growing season. Use half the recommended amount of fertilizer for Anthurium Warocqueanum.
## Watering
The Anthurium Warocqueanum likes to be kept moist, but not waterlogged. Water the plant when the top inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Be sure to use room temperature water as cold water can shock the plant's roots. The Anthurium Warocqueanum prefers a humidity level of 60-80%, so using a humidifier or placing a tray of water near the plant can help maintain the necessary humidity level.
## Common pests and issues
The Anthurium Warocqueanum can be susceptible to pests such as spider mites and mealybugs. Regularly inspect the leaves and stems for any signs of pests and treat as necessary. Yellowing or browning leaves can indicate over or under watering, so be sure to adjust your watering schedule accordingly.
## Propagation
Anthurium Warocqueanum can be propagated through stem cuttings or by division. To propagate with stem cuttings, simply take a cutting of a stem with at least one leaf and place it in moist soil or water. After a few weeks, roots should begin to grow, and the new plant can be transplanted into its own pot. For division, carefully separate the plant into two or more sections, each with its own roots and stem.
The safest bet is air layering or propagation on a moss pole made of sphagnum moss.
## Consider a grow tent or IKEA greenhouse
For optimal growing conditions, consider setting up a grow tent or greenhouse. This will allow you to control the temperature and humidity levels, and provide your Anthurium Warocqueanum with consistent lighting. An IKEA greenhouse can be an affordable option for those just starting out.
In conclusion, the Anthurium Warocqueanum is a beautiful and unique plant that can add a tropical touch to any home. By following these care guidelines, you can keep your Anthurium Warocqueanum healthy and thriving for years to come. Happy growing!
